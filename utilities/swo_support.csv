FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Pros Cons 

Single Sign-On Application
    Once Studies Weekly has synced your Clever roster data, your teachers, students, and admins should immediately be able to log into Studies Weekly Online using the **Studies Weekly Online 3.0** SSO application. 

Filter Shared Data
    Before sharing your roster with the Studies Weekly application, Clever provides you with a way to filter the data you share so that accounts and classrooms are only created for teachers, students, and admins that are using Studies Weekly Online.     
  * Studies Weekly also recommends adjusting the sharing rules specific to the subject (Social Studies, Science, Early Learning, or Health and Wellness) depending on what your district has ordered. This will reduce confusion and prevent unnecessary classrooms from being created within each user account.



Substitute Teachers
    Progress in the Studies Weekly Online articles is stored in the classroom. While it is possible to add substitutes manually to the Clever roster and append them to the existing classrooms, we have seen many issues with this method. Incorporating a substitute into the Clever data can lead to lost classroom progress and student confusion by having access to multiple classrooms in Studies Weekly Online. 

Troubleshooting the Roster
    As with our other third-party rostering options, Clever often requires the assistance of both the Clever support team and the Studies Weekly rostering team when troubleshooting issues. In some cases, you may be required to also work with the support team for your SIS software since not all SIS databases are 100% compatible with Clever.

Troubleshooting the Roster As with our other third-party rostering options, Clever often requires the assistance of both the Clever support team and the Studies Weekly rostering team when troubleshooting issues. In some cases, you may be required to also work with the support team for your SIS software since not all SIS databases are 100% compatible with Clever.

FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Pros Cons 

Simple Setup Process
    If your district already integrates your Student Information System (SIS) data into ClassLink, setting up the integration between your Roster and Studies Weekly Online is a quick and simple process. 

Automated Roster Updates
    After we set up the integration between your ClassLink Roster and Studies Weekly Online, your roster data will be scheduled to sync on a nightly basis. If you ever need to add or remove a teacher, change a class, or update the credentials on an account, these changes automatically process during the nightly sync. 

Single Sign-On Application
    Once we have synced your ClassLink roster data, your teacher, student, and admin accounts will be available to use immediately.Rostered users can connect to Studies Weekly Online directly from ClassLink, or by selecting **LOGIN WITH CLASSLINK** on the [login page](https://online.studiesweekly.com/login). 

Filter Shared Data
    Before sharing your roster with the Studies Weekly application, ClassLink provides you with a way to filter the shared data so that accounts and classrooms are only created for teachers, students, and admins who are using Studies Weekly Online.     
  * Studies Weekly also recommends adjusting the sharing rules specific to the subject (Social Studies, Science, Early Learning, or Health and Wellness) depending on what your district has ordered. This will reduce confusion and prevent unnecessary classrooms from being created within each user account.



Substitute Teachers
    As students read, highlight, interact with, and answer questions about each article online, their progress is stored in the online classroom. When you have a substitute teacher, you will not be able to add them as a co-teacher to your classroom. Studies Weekly has seen issues when substitutes are added through ClassLink. It often causes students to be assigned to multiple classrooms (yours and the sub’s), and sometimes results in lost article progress. 

Troubleshooting the Roster
    As with our other third-party rostering options, ClassLink can sometimes require the assistance of both the ClassLink support team and the Studies Weekly rostering team when troubleshooting account issues.

#  Legacy Science FAQ 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
With the Science publication, the student edition is bundled with three separate science units. Physical Science is the first section, then Earth Science, then Life Science. The teacher resource book also has three sections but in a slightly different order. Earth Science is first, then Life Science, then Physical Science. We have labels for each unit at the beginning of the week, on the worksheets, and on the assessment pages.We understand how the order of the different sections can be inconvenient, and we are looking into updating our teacher resource book next year to be in the same order as the student edition.Most people are familiar with our Social Studies publications, which have the student and teacher materials bundled together by quarters. However, our Science publications are broken down into 3 units; Earth Science, Life Science, and Physical Science. When you are viewing this publication online, you will be able to see Week 1-9 of Physical Science, then it starts over with Week 1 for Life Science, and again when it gets to Earth Science.The physical teacher materials are also divided by the 3 units. You may receive 3 booklets, one for each unit, or 1 booklet with three different sections. You will want to make sure you are using the appropriate unit section when you are teaching from your booklet. The online teacher materials will reflect the physical materials you received and show the 3 individual booklets by unit or all together in one booklet.

#  ClassLink - Troubleshooting 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
This article covers some of our most common questions we receive from ClassLink users. Additional questions can be directed to .
**My student is rostered, why can't they log in through ClassLink?**
1. Check if the student was added to the roster in ClassLink and shared to Studies Weekly, not just added to the Student Information System (SIS) data.
2. Check when they were added to the roster. Were they added after last night's sync? (Remember, we sync your roster data on a nightly basis).
3. Contact your district rostering administrator. They will need to log in through their rostering admin account, to check if the most recent sync was successful. If the sync failed, they can reach out to .
**Why can't our teachers invite co-teachers into their classroom?**
Teachers, students, and classrooms created through automated rostering can **only** be updated through the ClassLink rostering system. If a rostered teacher tries to invite a teacher to their rostered classroom, the new teacher won’t be able to join. They need to be **added** as a co-teacher of the classroom **on the ClassLink roster**.
**Why do my students see classes that aren’t from Studies Weekly in their account?**
If your students see other classes besides your Studies Weekly classroom, it is because your district rostering admin shared this information in their Student Information System (SIS) rostering data given to Studies Weekly.To avoid this, district rostering admins use ClassLink’s filtering options to narrow down what they are sharing. They can filter the shared data to remove classes, teachers, and students that will not be using Studies Weekly. That way only Studies Weekly classroom information will show on student accounts. If the roster data is not filtered, students may be added to multiple classes that are not utilizing Studies Weekly publications, such as Math, Gym, etc.
**We have 3 different Studies Weekly Applications in ClassLink. Which one should I use to log in?**
The Studies Weekly 3.0 Oauth 2 app with the blue logo is the current application your district should use for single sign-on.

#  Article/Explore More Comprehension Question Delay 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Article and Explore More comprehension questions are automatically graded by Studies Weekly Online and students receive immediate feedback while answering them. Students have unlimited chances to select the correct response, but they are incentivized with coins to correctly answer each question in as few attempts as possible.
If a student answers an Article comprehension question or Explore More Media question incorrectly, they will not be able to select a different response or move on to the next question for a short amount of time. The delay gives the student an opportunity to go back to the article to find the correct answer or read the question again before they make another attempt.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37039477094299)
Students are required to answer all questions before moving on to the the next task.

#  How to Earn Coins 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Students can earn coins by answering questions on Articles, Activities, Weekly Assessments, Crosswords, Misspilled, Customized Content, and Explore More media. Students can use these coins in the Study Buddies and Explorers games. 
Recommendation
See the [How to Play Explorers](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/5481133657115-Explorers-and-Gems) article to learn more about using coins and earning gems.
Student View Teacher View
Students can view how many coins they have below their username on the **Classrooms** page. For example, this student has 3884 coins:
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31268565551003)
Teachers can view how many coins a student has by going to their Classroom, then selecting the **People** tab. Click the **three dots** next to the student’s name, then click **Add Coins** or **Login As** to see how many total coins they have.![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31268557013787)
#### **Coins for Articles**
Articles with no comprehension questions will have a timer at the bottom of the page. When the time elapses, a **Collect Coins** button appears. Students can click that button to show they read the article and earn 5 coins.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/18183600886427)
#### **Coins for Article Comprehension and Explore More Media Questions**
Article comprehension and Explore More media questions are automatically graded when a student selects an answer. They are worth 10, 5, 3, or 1 coin(s) depending on how many tries it takes to get the correct answer. 
Note
  * 1st attempt = 10 coins
  * 2nd attempt = 5 coins 
  * 3rd attempt = 3 coins
  * Last attempt = 1 coins


_There is no submit button, so students are automatically awarded these coins based on the number of attempts._
#### **Coins for Activities**
Some Activities will also have comprehension questions that are automatically graded. Activities that need to be done outside of Studies Weekly Online (e.g., on a separate piece of paper) will have an image at the bottom of the page and a Submit button. Students automatically earn 5 coins when they click **Submit**.
![Activity_image_new.png](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/11297879321499)
Once a student clicks the button to submit the activity, it shows up in the Grade section (see the [How to ](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13879825760155-How-to-Navigate-the-Grade-Section)[Navigate the Grade Section](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13879825760155-How-to-Navigate-the-Grade-Section) article). Questions that are teacher-graded show up as **Needs to be Graded**. For those, the teacher can mark the activity as Correct, Partially Correct, or Incorrect.
Note
  * Correct (100%) = 5 additional coins per question
  * Partially Correct = 3 additional coins per question
  * Incorrect = 1 additional coin per question


_This is in addition to the 5 coins a student receives for submitting the activity._
#### **Coins for Weekly Assessments and Customized Content**
Students earn 5 coins for simply submitting their answers to Weekly Assessments and Customized Content questions. 
Once a student clicks the button to submit the Weekly Assessment or Customized Content, it shows up in the Grade section for the teacher. Questions that are teacher-graded show up as **Needs to be Graded**. For those, the teacher can mark the Weekly Assessment or Customized Content as Correct, Partially Correct, or Incorrect.
Note
  * Correct (100%) = 5 additional coins per question
  * Partially Correct = 3 additional coins per question
  * Incorrect = 1 additional coin per question


_This is in addition to the 5 coins a student receives for completing or submitting the Weekly Assessment or Customized Content._
#### **Coins for Crossword Vocabulary Reviews**
Once a student completes a Crossword and hits Submit, it is automatically graded. They receive 5 coins for submitting the Crossword, then additional coins based on their score.
Note
  * Correct (100%) = 5 additional coins per question
  * Partially Correct = 3 additional coins per question
  * Incorrect = 1 additional coin per question


_This is in addition to the 5 coins a student receives for submitting the Crossword._
#### **Coins for Misspilled Vocabulary Reviews**
Students also earn coins by completing the Misspilled. The amount of coins earned is equal to the tiered amount of time the vocabulary review is completed in. 
Note
  * Less than 2 minutes = 40 coins
  * Less than 3 minutes = 20 coins
  * Less than 4 minutes = 10 coins


For example, a student who completes it in 1 minute would earn 70 coins total (40 + 20 + 10). A student that completes it in 2.5 minutes would earn 30 coins total (20 + 10).
Teachers can manually add coins to a student’s account (see the [How to Add Coins](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/8294570263067-How-to-Add-Coins) article). Students will see a notification above their username. Clicking the bell will show students the Coins Alert and a note from their teacher.

#  End-of-Year Rostering FAQs 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Many districts and schools are rostered through the Studies Weekly platform. At the end of each school year, you will need to close out your rostered accounts. See further info below.
**What do we need to do to close out the year?**
We recommend that teachers and admin gather any data and reports needed for their documentation before June 30. This is when all current school year order access to online publications will be turned off.
Teachers and admin can view the Studies Weekly [ Reports](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/sections/5647354289435-Reports) section and the article [ How to Navigate the Grade Section](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13879825760155-How-to-Navigate-the-Grade-Section) within the knowledge base for resources on how to gather this information.
#### Note
Schools with summer school publications will have access to those publications from May 15 to August 1. You can visit the [Studies Weekly Data & Legal Policy ](https://www.studiesweekly.com/legal/) for more online access information.
**Does anything need to be done to the accounts from the district/school side?**
No action needs to be taken on the district’s/school’s end to close out rostered accounts.
**When do we need to get ready for the beginning of the year?**
We recommend you confirm that your roster information is up to date and that user accounts are appearing as they should by mid-summer. If you have rostered with us in the previous school year, and you are not making changes to your rostering method, your rostering integration will remain active an you will not need to contact us. 
If you will be changing roster types for the next school year, you need to fill out the rostering form on the [ Studies Weekly Rostering Page](https://www.studiesweekly.com/rostering/). Any rostering admins who are making minor changes, such as adding new schools to the roster, or anyone with specific questions can email .
**What will happen to accounts if we change rostering types? Will teacher and student data remain?**
Studies Weekly Online will determine account continuity based on the email field of your rostered user records. If the user has the same email in both rostering methods, then the new rostering method will seamlessly merge into the existing account for the previous rostering method. 
Classrooms managed by the old rostering method will always be archived. Any progress in these archived classrooms will be available in a read-only state. 
**Our district will be adjusting some data in our rosters over the summer. Will this affect accounts?**
Normally changes to data **only** affects accounts if that changed data is: the SIS ID, Clever/Classlink ID, username, and/or email (if the email is also the username). If there are other specific data changes that you still have questions about, please reach out to [rostering@studiesweekly.com](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/rostering@studiesweekly.com).
**How soon will teachers gain access to Studies Weekly materials through the roster?**
Online access for the next school year’s orders will begin June 15. As long as an order is placed and the roster is set up, the teachers will be able to access their materials.

[Getting Started with Rostering ](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/sections/18713449851291-Getting-Started-with-Rostering) End-of-Year Rostering FAQs FollowNot yet followed by anyone Many districts and schools are rostered through the Studies Weekly platform. At the end of each school year, you will need to close out your rostered accounts. See further info below. **What do we need to do to close out the year?** We recommend that teachers and admin gather any data and reports needed for their documentation before June 30. This is when all current school year order access to online publications will be turned off. Teachers and admin can view the Studies Weekly [ Reports](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/sections/5647354289435-Reports) section and the article [ How to Navigate the Grade Section](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13879825760155-How-to-Navigate-the-Grade-Section) within the knowledge base for resources on how to gather this information. Note Schools with summer school publications will have access to those publications from May 15 to August 1. You can visit the (https://www.studiesweekly.com/legal/) for more online access information. **Does anything need to be done to the accounts from the district/school side?** No action needs to be taken on the district’s/school’s end to close out rostered accounts. **When do we need to get ready for the beginning of the year?** We recommend you confirm that your roster information is up to date and that user accounts are appearing as they should by mid-summer. If you have rostered with us in the previous school year, and you are not making changes to your rostering method, your rostering integration will remain active an you will not need to contact us. If you will be changing roster types for the next school year, you need to fill out the rostering form on the (https://www.studiesweekly.com/rostering/). Any rostering admins who are making minor changes, such as adding new schools to the roster, or anyone with specific questions can email . **What will happen to accounts if we change rostering types? Will teacher and student data remain?** Studies Weekly Online will determine account continuity based on the email field of your rostered user records. If the user has the same email in both rostering methods, then the new rostering method will seamlessly merge into the existing account for the previous rostering method. Classrooms managed by the old rostering method will always be archived. Any progress in these archived classrooms will be available in a read-only state. **Our district will be adjusting some data in our rosters over the summer. Will this affect accounts?** Normally changes to data **only** affects accounts if that changed data is: the SIS ID, Clever/Classlink ID, username, and/or email (if the email is also the username). If there are other specific data changes that you still have questions about, please reach out to [rostering@studiesweekly.com](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/rostering@studiesweekly.com). **How soon will teachers gain access to Studies Weekly materials through the roster?** Online access for the next school year’s orders will begin June 15. As long as an order is placed and the roster is set up, the teachers will be able to access their materials.

#  Studies Weekly CSV - Troubleshooting 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
This article covers some of the most common questions we receive from Studies Weekly CSV users. Additional questions can be directed to .
**What is the School ID and where can we find that?**
The school_id column in the schools.csv template file is just a unique identifier we require so that the school can be identified in the teacher file and assigned to the right teacher accounts. This number can be made up, as long as each school on your list has a unique ID.
**Why can't our teachers invite co-teachers into their classroom?**
Teachers, students, and classrooms created through CSV rostering can only be updated through the roster. If a rostered teacher tries to invite a teacher to their rostered classroom, the new teacher won’t be able to join. They need to be added as a co-teacher of the classroom in the teacher_class.csv template file.
**How do I create parent accounts and principal accounts with CSV rostering?**
Currently, only teacher and student accounts can be created through the CSV file upload. We are working to add additional roles, but for now, this must be done manually. If your district needs accounts created for school admins, please reach out to .
**Do we have to upload all 5 files each time we need to add a user or classroom?**
If you are uploading the files directly through the district admin account provided by Studies Weekly, then yes. Any time you need to add or remove a teacher, student, or classroom, you will need to re-upload all 5 CSV template files (schools.csv, teachers.csv, students.csv, classes.csv, student_class.csv). Even if the change is just for one student, all of these CSV files are needed because they designate how your roster connects to Studies Weekly Online.If you use a file transfer protocol (FTP) client, then we can help you automate the file upload process to the FTP server directly. If not, our explains how you can zip the files and upload the zipped file to save time.

Pros Cons 

Automated Rostering through FTP
    Due to the widespread use of the OneRoster CSV format, it is compatible with most Student Information Systems (SIS) and roster servers. It is easy to use as well, because you can automatically import roster data into OneRoster CSV files and then upload them to the Studies Weekly Online file transfer protocol (FTP) server. Once uploaded, Studies Weekly Online syncs all files on a nightly basis. If you add or remove a student, teacher, or classroom through OneRoster, then that updated information will be in Studies Weekly Online by the next day. 

Multiple Formats Supported
    Studies Weekly Online supports the 1.0 and the 1.1 format versions for OneRoster CSV files. 

Single Sign-On through Google
    If the teacher and student accounts are rostered using Google-sourced emails for the usernames of the accounts, you can quickly and easily access Studies Weekly Online without the need to memorize a username or password.After verifying their Google Account, students and teachers can use one of the following options to automatically log in each time:1. Go through our [Single Sign-on interface](https://online.studiesweekly.com/online/google)2. Go to [online.studiesweekly.com](https://online.studiesweekly.com/login) and select the **LOGIN WITH GOOGLE** button. 

Google Classroom
    After setting up the teacher and student accounts with Google-sourced email addresses, the teachers can also utilize the Google Classroom integration in Studies Weekly Online. 

Unable to Filter Data
    There are some roster servers and SIS servers that don't provide the ability to filter the data that is being shared to the CSV files that are uploaded to the Studies Weekly FTP server. Because of this, there may be teachers, students, and classrooms that are created in Studies Weekly Online for users that are not using the Studies Weekly publication. 

Limited Visibility
    When you share your roster with Studies Weekly Online through a third party service such as ClassLink or Clever, that roster becomes accessible for Studies Weekly support to view in cases where we are assisting with troubleshooting your roster. With OneRoster CSV connections, we can reference the files you have uploaded to our FTP server, but this information may not reflect all of the data in your roster server, so it may be more difficult for our Customer Service team to assist with tech troubleshooting.

#  How to Navigate Rostering and Integrations 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
If districts choose to use Studies Weekly to roster their accounts, they can create and manage user accounts for teachers and students district-wide through a variety of automated processes. Studies Weekly is also able to integrate roster data through third-party applications, such as ClassLink or Clever to allow Single Sign On with these applications. 
Each user included in the data that is sent through the roster connection will be given a Studies Weekly Online account and will be assigned either a district admin, school admin, teacher, or student role. The users will also be assigned to the classroom(s) specified in the roster data.
Studies Weekly recommends adjusting the sharing rules specific to the subject (Social Studies, Science, Early Learning, or Health and Wellness) depending on what your district has ordered. This will reduce confusion and prevent unnecessary classrooms from being created within each user account. If your SIS is not able to filter down the data you send us, the OneRoster CSV option below may be a better solution for you.
#### Attention
To get started with any of these rostering methods, please head over to <https://www.studiesweekly.com/rostering/#GettingStarted> and fill out the rostering form. An email will be sent to the provided contact informing the the next steps.
**Third Party Integrations API CSV File Upload Integration **
**ClassLink**
ClassLink is one of our third-party applications that has very little maintenance and setup. Once the connection is established, Studies Weekly Online accounts will be created based on the data shared from ClassLink. Studies Weekly can import your school's roster directly from ClassLink to synchronize your schools' user accounts each night. Your district will be able to choose what data is shared with Studies Weekly through ClassLink. The users and classrooms that were shared will be created in Studies Weekly Online. They will be able to log in to their ClassLink account and find the Studies Weekly application to launch into their Studies Weekly Online account.
**Clever**
Clever is another third-party application that integrates with Studies Weekly. A connection with Clever requires your district to request to connect with Studies Weekly by locating the Studies Weekly application in Clever’s application library and requesting to connect. Once the connection is approved by someone on Studies Weekly’s team, your district can begin sharing data with us. You’ll want to ensure your district has purchased Studies Weekly publications so your users can gain access through their Clever portal. 
After your connection is approved and the launch date is established, Studies Weekly will create user accounts. Users will be able to log in to their Clever account and find the Studies Weekly application to launch their Studies Weekly Online account. 
Note
Once your users are rostered, publications will be auto-assigned based on data provided in the roster. For example, if you provide the class grade level in the data, publications will be assigned to that classroom automatically for that grade level. If grade data is not provided, no publications will be auto-assigned and teachers will need to manually add publications to their classrooms. Teachers can add or remove publications by following [these instructions](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/5086944167323-How-to-Add-Publications-to-a-Classroom).
Studies Weekly can receive your district's roster data and information through an API connection that is compatible with OneRoster. If your student information system (SIS) is OneRoster compatible, Studies Weekly will provide a way for your district to send us your credentials to connect with us directly. 
ClassLink is OneRoster certified, which means we integrate well with ClassLink through API. ClassLink provides a launchpad for your users to access Studies Weekly while only having to login to one place to access your Studies Weekly publication(s). 
### OneRoster API Integration
Studies Weekly can receive your district's roster data and information through an API connection, which means you’ll be sending data from your SIS directly to Studies Weekly. We currently have support for an API connection that follows OneRoster specifications. To set up an API connection, send an email to  to let them know what Student Information System (SIS) you have and that you’d like to connect through OneRoster API. Studies Weekly will provide a way for your district to send us your credentials to complete the API connection. 
Important
Please note that we recommend adjusting the sharing rules specific to the subject (Social Studies, Science, Early Learning, or Health and Wellness) depending on what your district has ordered. This will reduce confusion and prevent unnecessary classrooms from being created within each user account.
If your SIS is not able to filter down the data you send us, the OneRoster CSV option below may be a better solution for you.
Studies Weekly is compatible with two CSV file formats to give your district the ability to choose what will best meet your needs. Studies Weekly is able to accept OneRoster formatted files or Studies Weekly formatted files. You can choose the frequency in which files are uploaded. Regardless of when files are uploaded, files are processed each night to provide you the latest information as soon as the next morning.
### OneRoster Formatted Files
Studies Weekly is able to accept OneRoster CSV files through Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). You can choose what data you send us by exporting the required files from your SIS with the required fields selected. Studies Weekly will provide you with SFTP credentials so you can access our server to upload files as needed. Once files are uploaded and the nightly sync occurs, your users will have accounts created. 
**See the list of Mandatory CSVs and important notes on the ClassLink website.**
### Studies Weekly Formatted Files
If your district is not able to export OneRoster formatted files or if you’d prefer to personally manage the user data, Studies Weekly has its own format in which you can provide CSV files. 
You will be assigned a district admin account where you can upload your files for validating and file processing. Files will first be validated, which just means they’ll be scanned for any breaks in your data. The files will then be processed later that night during the nightly sync. If you reach out to  during the setup, we can manually push the sync to ensure everything is working so you don’t have to wait to know if the data is processing accurately. 
After the initial setup and once you have a successful sync, Studies Weekly can provide you with SFTP credentials to access our server and upload files as often as you’d like. 
**Studies Weekly Required CSVs**
[schools.csv](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/resources/schools.csv)
This file is used to provide us with each school in your district that will be using Studies Weekly. Each school using Studies Weekly must be listed in this file in order for accounts to be created and for your users to see the publications your district has purchased.
[teachers.csv](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/resources/teachers.csv)
This file is used to create user accounts for anyone you’d like to have the teacher role on their account. We will use the teacher's email address as their username and they will be able to use the reset password link to set up their account for the first time. If you’d prefer, we have the ability to send each new user an email with their login information. 
[students.csv](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/marketing/Spreadsheets/students.csv)
This file is used to create user accounts for anyone that needs the student role on their account. How you set their username and password will be dependent on which method you would like your students to login with. 
For Google SSO, this file will contain four columns: student name, student email, student ID and username. The Google hosted email address must be assigned in the username column.
For custom usernames and passwords, this file will contain five columns: student name, student email, student ID, username, password*.
*_Each password_** _must_** _be at least 5 characters and include a number. If no password is provided, please include the header in the file, and we will auto generate one for you._
This file is used to create all of the classrooms at any and all schools within your district. This is also where you will assign the main teacher to their classroom. Additional teachers can be assigned to a class in the teacher_class.csv file. In order for your teachers to have a classroom online, a classroom needs to be declared in this file.
[student_class.csv](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/resources/student_class.csv)
This file is used to assign students to classrooms. If you find that one of your teachers is missing a student, you can check this file to ensure they are assigned to their teacher accordingly. 
[teacher_class.csv (optional)](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/resources/teacher_class.csv)
This file is used to assign a co-teacher or a second teacher to a classroom. The teachers added to this file will have the same abilities as the main teacher. The only ability the main teacher will have that the secondary teacher will not is deleting a classroom. The main teacher will be assigned in the classes.csv file.
After all the files have been created, it is recommended that you maintain a ‘final file’ of each on your desktop. As changes happen throughout the year, you will add to or remove from the files.
Whatever data is in your files will be reflected online. If you remove any users from the files and upload a different file, users will be removed and added accordingly. 
Once your users are rostered, teachers will need to manually add publications to their classrooms. Teachers can add additional publications to their classroom if needed.
Note
All column headers and filenames MUST be identical to those listed in the OneRoster specifications. All columns listed in the specifications are also required. If a column indicates it is not required, the column itself is required, but the data for each row can be blank.
All CSV files MUST be UTF-8 encoded or the process will not be successful.

#  Professional Development Classroom 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
**_(Currently available to support unpacking the TEKS in Texas Science publications.)_**
The Professional Development section allows admins to create a classroom for educators and assign an on-demand Professional Development Publication. It can only be assigned by a district or school admin in Studies Weekly Online and is not visible to students.
The Professional Development Publication assigned to the classroom looks just like a student publication. Users who are enrolled, will answer Article Questions, just like a student. District or school admins will have access to view teachers’ completion in the Gradebook. 
Create Grade
To assign the publication to teachers, the district or school admin must first create a Professional Development classroom. Select the Professional Development tab from the top navigation bar.
After selecting the Professional Development button for the first time, admins will be prompted to create their classroom.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31530317956123)
Additional classrooms can be created using the **Create Classroom** button in the top right corner of the screen.
#### **Step 1 of 3: Enter Classroom Information**
Changes can be made to the class name, dates, or class image after saving, by visiting the **Classroom Settings** of the **Classroom Card.**
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31530059195035)
#### **Step 2 of 3: Choose Publication**
The available Professional Development Publication(s) will depend on your district or school. Select the available publication and choose **Continue** in the bottom right corner.
#### **Step 3 of 3: Assign Users**
District admins can assign teachers throughout the district to the Professional Development class. School admins creating a class, can assign teachers or other admins within their building to the class.
Studies Weekly Online users registered as a district or school admin can be given access to participate in the class as an **Admin** or **Teacher**. These users will have a checkbox beside their name for both the **Admin** column and the **Teacher** column (when selecting users for the class). Examples of admin users in the image below include Hazel Nutt and Marsha Mellow.
  * Selecting the **Admin Checkbox** will allow Gradebook access and users will navigate as if teaching the class. Additionally, they can assign or remove teachers.
  * If the **Teacher Checkbox** is selected, those users will participate in the Professional Development class as a student and can only see their own progress.![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31530095657371)


After choosing schools and user roles with the **Checkboxes** , finish by selecting **Create Classroom**.
If you need to add or remove users after creating the classroom, visit the **People** section of the **Classroom Card**.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31530059208219)
Note
After teachers have been assigned to a class, the Professional Development publication will be available in their dashboard. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/26951029480091)
**Gradebook:**
The Gradebook will be available to users that have Admin access to the publication and will show which teachers have been assigned to the publication and who has completed the comprehension questions. 
Teachers must answer each multiple choice question correctly before advancing, exactly the same way that students respond to [Article Comprehension Questions](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/23813451785115-Article-Comprehension-Questions). This ensures mastery before progressing. Answers to questions are found within the articles and teachers are encouraged to go back to the Article to find the answer with every incorrect response. Unlimited attempts are available to reach the correct answer. Therefore, completion of Article Comprehension Questions will be shown with a checkmark in the Gradebook, as a reflection that they reached the correct responses. 
To begin, select**Grade** from the **Classroom Card.**
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31530059213723)
Use the available filters to view any completion data for Article Questions.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/26951132959771)
Select a **Teacher Name** to view how they responded to questions.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/23987776115739)
**Quick Grade:**
Quick Grade will only be necessary if there are Assessments or Activities that have questions that require grading.

#  How To View Weekly Progress 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Students can view their weekly progress in the Table of Contents section by Publication. Each week of content displays progress information:
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/38792631408155)
  1. This box shows the progress bar displays the percentage of required articles students have completed for that week.
  2. As students progress, they earn coins for completing articles and activities. Each week shows how many coins the student has collected and how many coins remain.
  3. If students have taken the weekly assessment, an **Assessment Score** will appear. If the teacher has given the option to retake it, a **Retake Assessment** button will be available below the score.
  4. If students have not taken the weekly assessment, they will see a **Take Assessment** button. This is also true for a student if the teacher has allowed for a retake.
  5. Text saying “Assessment Not Available” will show if the teacher has turned the assessment off or there is not a Studies Weekly Online assessment for that week.

#  How to Generate Student Usernames and Passwords 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Teachers can create new student accounts. When a new student account is created, teachers will be prompted to choose a username and password for the student. This article addresses some common issues with student usernames and passwords.
From your [Studies Weekly Online](https://online.studiesweekly.com/) account and within the desired**Classroom Card:**
  1. Click **People**.
  2. In the Students bar, click the click the **Create Student** button ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/17890870916123) to create a unique username and password for your students. In the dialog box that appears, type a **First Name** , **Last Name** , **Username** , and **Password**.


![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/30679153951771)
You may find auto-filled information or a message stating that the username is taken. Click on the tabs below to see how to resolve these issues.
**Browser Auto-fills Information**
Sometimes the browser will automatically fill the _First Name_ , _Last Name_ , _Username_ , and _Password_ with your saved information. Delete your information to type in the student’s name, username, and password.
**The Username is Taken**
Studies Weekly has students in all 50 states using the online product. Usernames must be unique so they don’t access another student's account. If the username has already been taken, try adding a number to the name or use the student's school ID number.
**The Student Already Has a Username and Password**
If students have used Studies Weekly Online before, they can continue to use the same username and password. The student will need to be transferred from the previous class to the new class.
If the student doesn’t remember their previous username and password, ask their previous teacher for the student’s login information.
For more ways to add students, see the [How to Add Students to Your Classroom](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/5088800547611-How-to-Add-Students-to-Your-Classroom) article. To edit existing student usernames and passwords individually or in bulk, see the [How to Edit Student Accounts](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/5294959965339-How-To-Edit-Student-Accounts) article.

#  Utilizing Google Translate in Studies Weekly Online 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Teachers and admins can enable Google Translate for students who require language support, as well as for their own use.

The page will automatically refresh and the Google Translate option will appear in the top navigation bar. Use the **Select Language** bar to change the language.![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/38784702915483)
To quickly turn translation back off for your Studies Weekly Online account, use the **Options** dropdown above the top navigation bar and choose **Turn off translation for this site** or click the **X** next to the dropdown.![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/38784702917147)
#### **Enable Google Translate for Students**
Some students could benefit from having Google translate enabled. Teachers can enable it for one student at a time or for all students in the **People** section.![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/38820365821595)

#  How to Create “Words to Know” Vocabulary Notebooks 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
In your Teacher Edition or in Teacher Resources, you may notice one of the needed materials listed is a “Words to Know” notebook. This is a domain-specific vocabulary notebook we recommend teachers make to help students keep track of new words they learn each week. You can create a class set or have each student create their own.
[![Vocab_Notebook_video.png](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/4406842842395)](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/videos/pdod/Words%20To%20Know%20Vocabulary%20Notebook.mp4)
## **How to Make “Words to Know” Notebooks**
  1. Purchase a composition notebook or spiral notebook from a discount store.
  2. Download one of our “Words to Know” vocabulary notebook cover sheets (see below).
  3. Use glue to stick the cover sheet onto the front of your composition or spiral-bound notebook.
  4. Write your name (or have each student write their name) in the space provided at the top of the cover sheet.
  5. For a class set notebook, write the letter A at the top of the first two pages of your notebook (so you’re only writing on the right-side page). On the next two pages, write the letter B. Continue through the alphabet all the way to the letter Z. For student notebooks, have each student do this in their notebook.
  6. Look for suggested vocabulary words in your Teacher Edition or in Teacher Resources. Write those words in your notebook (or have students write them in theirs).
  7. At the end of each week, do a shared activity with your class where you go over the vocabulary words for that week.
  8. Have the words upon the board where students can see them.
  9. Elicit definitions for each word from your students.
  10. Have students write their definitions in their notebooks, or write their definitions into the class set notebook.


Have older students site where they found their definitions.
For ESL students, have them write definitions in their home language, draw pictures, or cut out images from their Studies Weekly student edition and glue them into their notebook.

#  How to Select Shipping Preferences 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Studies Weekly has updated the order process for all orders made online, by phone, mail, or fax to include the options for Partial Shipments and Blackout Dates. To determine which options are the right choice for you, please review the information below.
### Full vs. Partial Shipping
Orders will **only** ship once **all** products are in stock **unless** you opt in to receive partial shipments. Partial shipping means available products will ship out right as they become available. If you decide to select the option to receive partial shipments, various SKUs may be sent to you at different times, depending on when each product is in stock.
If you are placing your order online, these shipping options are available on the Checkout page. Please check the box next to your shipping preference.
####  Attention
Please note that large orders using freight shipment do not have the option for partial shipping.
![Screen_Shot_2021-06-14_at_7.55.28_AM.png](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/4402308749083)
### Selecting Blackout Dates
Blackout Dates are timeframes that you are not available to receive a delivery. By selecting a Blackout window, this will ensure that your materials will not arrive when your school or district office is closed.
If you are available any weekday to receive your order, simply check the box next to “ _I can receive shipment at any time”_ and we’ll ship your order as soon as possible.
If you have a period of time when you are not available to receive your order, click the button _“Add Date Range”_ to specify which days you are unavailable. You can add multiple date ranges as needed.
![Screen_Shot_2021-06-15_at_3.28.49_PM.png](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/4402308766107)
When you are adding a date range for your Blackout Dates, a calendar will appear where you can select the first date of the Blackout and highlight the duration of your outage.
####  Attention
Please note that you do **not** need to specify weekends or national holidays for Blackout dates, as shipments will only arrive on regular business days.
![Screen_Shot_2021-06-15_at_4.25.24_PM.png](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/4402316523547)
You may select up to five Blackout date spans, as necessary. We will not ship out any materials to you during your selected blackout dates. You can also remove any blackout dates you don’t need by selecting the red trash can icon on the right.
![Screen_Shot_2021-06-15_at_4.44.40_PM.png](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/4402308791067)
Note
If you do not select an option for either partial or full shipment on your order, and no blackout dates are provided, your order will default to partial shipping starting in mid-August.

#  Professional Development Publication for Teachers 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
**_(Currently available to support unpacking the TEKS in Texas Science publications.)_**
Professional Development content will only be available on your dashboard if a Studies Weekly district or school admin has assigned it to you. It contains an on-demand Professional Development Publication for educators and is not visible to students.
If you have been assigned to a Professional Development Classroom by an administrator, you will see the Professional Development tab under Classes.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/27068820535579)
From there, select the available publication from the **Classroom Card.**
Using the navigation arrows in the Table of Contents, you can open the first Week and Article of the Professional Development content, or pick up where you left off.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/27069006280219)
The Professional Development publication looks and functions like a student publication. Users who are enrolled in this publication will read the articles and answer the comprehension questions as a student. They will not be able to clear their responses since participation is required from their admin. District and/or school admins will have access to view teachers’ completion in the Gradebook.

#  How to Roster with the Studies Weekly CSV Method 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Along with rostering through third-party applications such as Clever and ClassLink, Studies Weekly also provides a first-party CSV rostering method. This option is useful for districts that utilize Google-sourced emails for their teachers and students and automate their file uploads using SFTP. The Studies Weekly CSV rostering method is also compatible with users who are not able to automate their file uploads and are not using Google-sourced emails. These users will need to log into the **[Studies Weekly Online](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/online.studiesweekly.com)** site directly.
If your district is interested in rostering with Studies Weekly CSV, we have created a helpful presentation to walk you through the process of where to download the CSV template files and how to properly format and upload them. Click to begin setting up your CSV roster.
**Studies Weekly Required CSVs**
**[schools.csv](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/resources/schools.csv)**
This file is used to provide us with each school in your district that will be using Studies Weekly. Each school using Studies Weekly must be listed in this file in order for accounts to be created and for your users to see the publications your district has purchased.
**[teachers.csv](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/resources/teachers.csv)**
This file is used to create user accounts for anyone you’d like to have the teacher role on their account. We will use the teacher's email address as their username, and they will be able to use the reset password link to set up their account for the first time. If you’d prefer, we have the ability to send each new user an email with their login information. 
**[students.csv](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/marketing/Spreadsheets/students.csv)**
This file is used to create user accounts for anyone that needs the student role on their account. How you set their username and password will be dependent on which method you would like your students to log in with. 
For Google SSO, this file will contain four columns: student name, student email, student ID and username. The Google-hosted email address must be assigned in the username column.
For custom usernames and passwords, this file will contain five columns: student name, student email, student ID, username, and password*.
*_Each password_** _must_** _be at least 5 characters and include a number. If no password is provided, please include the header in the file, and we will auto-generate one for you._
**[classes.csv](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/resources/classes.csv)**
This file is used to create all of the classrooms at any and all schools within your district. This is also where you will assign the main teacher to their classroom. Additional teachers can be assigned to a class in the teacher_class.csv file. In order for your teachers to have a classroom online, a classroom needs to be declared in this file.
**[student_class.csv](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/resources/student_class.csv)**
This file is used to assign students to classrooms. If you find that one of your teachers is missing a student, you can check this file to ensure they are assigned to their teacher accordingly. 
**[teacher_class.csv (optional)](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/resources/teacher_class.csv)**
This file is used to assign a co-teacher or a second teacher to a classroom. The teachers added to this file will have the same abilities as the main teacher. The only ability the main teacher will have that the secondary teacher will not is deleting a classroom. The main teacher will be assigned in the classes.csv file.

This option is useful for districts that utilize Google-sourced emails for their teachers and students and automate their file uploads using SFTP. The Studies Weekly CSV rostering method is also compatible with users who are not able to automate their file uploads and are not using Google-sourced emails. These users will need to log into the ** (https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/online.studiesweekly.com)** site directly. If your district is interested in rostering with Studies Weekly CSV, we have created a helpful presentation to walk you through the process of where to download the CSV template files and how to properly format and upload them. Click to begin setting up your CSV roster. **Studies Weekly Required CSVs** **[schools.csv](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/resources/schools.csv)** This file is used to provide us with each school in your district that will be using Studies Weekly. Each school using Studies Weekly must be listed in this file in order for accounts to be created and for your users to see the publications your district has purchased. **[teachers.csv](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/resources/teachers.csv)** This file is used to create user accounts for anyone you’d like to have the teacher role on their account. We will use the teacher's email address as their username, and they will be able to use the reset password link to set up their account for the first time. If you’d prefer, we have the ability to send each new user an email with their login information. **[students.csv](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/marketing/Spreadsheets/students.csv)** This file is used to create user accounts for anyone that needs the student role on their account. How you set their username and password will be dependent on which method you would like your students to log in with. For Google SSO, this file will contain four columns: student name, student email, student ID and username. The Google-hosted email address must be assigned in the username column. For custom usernames and passwords, this file will contain five columns: student name, student email, student ID, username, and password*. *_Each password_** _must_** _be at least 5 characters and include a number. If no password is provided, please include the header in the file, and we will auto-generate one for you._ **[classes.csv](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/resources/classes.csv)** This file is used to create all of the classrooms at any and all schools within your district. This is also where you will assign the main teacher to their classroom. Additional teachers can be assigned to a class in the teacher_class.csv file. In order for your teachers to have a classroom online, a classroom needs to be declared in this file. **[student_class.csv](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/resources/student_class.csv)** This file is used to assign students to classrooms. If you find that one of your teachers is missing a student, you can check this file to ensure they are assigned to their teacher accordingly. **[teacher_class.csv (optional)](https://cdn.studiesweekly.com/online/resources/teacher_class.csv)** This file is used to assign a co-teacher or a second teacher to a classroom. The teachers added to this file will have the same abilities as the main teacher. The only ability the main teacher will have that the secondary teacher will not is deleting a classroom. The main teacher will be assigned in the classes.csv file. Need Assistance?

#  How to Navigate the Customized Content Page 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Teachers can manage their content, like custom quizzes, on the Customized Content page. This article will cover the options for all Customized Content and actions available for each option. 
Making edits to an existing Studies Weekly Online assessment creates a new copy that appears on the Customized Content page. 
From your [Studies Weekly Online](https://online.studiesweekly.com/) account and within the desired **Classroom Card** , click the **Customized Content button**.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/38821883803803)
Note
Customized Content is only accessible to students in their **To Do** tab. 
### Options for All Customized Content
The options at the top of the page allow you to find, sort, and add Customized Content and select from **To Do** or **Archived**.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37530162464283)
  * **Find Customized Content** : Search for a Customized Content you’ve already created.
  * **Sort By:** Sort customized content by Created Date, Due Date, or Title, Created by Admin, or To Do Order.
  * **![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37530162466715)Create Customized Content:** See the [How to Create Customized Content](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/4861136293787) article
  * **![three_dots.png](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/12439988779291)Actions** : Import tests from Legacy Studies Weekly Online or refresh Customized Content.


### Actions for Individual Customized Content
In the **To Do** section of the Customized Content page, teachers will see all customized content assignments with a future due date. 
The **Archived** section will show all the customized content assignments with an expired due date. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37530144525339)
To the left of the title of each Customized Content, teachers will see the **Move** icon ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/17682569770523). This allows teachers to reorder their view of content with a drag and drop. This will also reorder content in the students **To Do** tab. 
On the right, use the **Visibility Toggles** to hide or make content visible.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37530162471579)
Important Note
To change the order of your Customized Content, you must use the dropdown box and navigate to **To Do Order.** You may also need to clear your cookies and cache if you do not see the **Move** icon. 
To the right of each piece of Customized Content, select the **three dots** ![Screen_Shot_2022-09-02_at_13.07.35.png](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/8546507411355) to see the actions available.

![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/30164900834459)
The drop down menu also allows you to select **Question Type Overview**. This shows a list of students and their scores, but graphs them by percentage.
**Edit**
Edit the title, instructions, dates/times, or decide if you want to **Randomize Questions**. Changes can also be made to the questions if no students have started the Customized Content.
As long as no students have started the Customized Content, the teacher can add or make edits to questions, answers, and the point value.
When the Customized Content does have responses submitted by any student:
  * Teachers can make changes to the **Title,****Instructions** , and **Start/End Date** at any time. 
  * If a teacher attempts to make edits to **Questions** , **Answers** , or **Point Value** after any student has begun the Customized Content a pop-up will appear stating **“A student has already started the**** _“Insert title of Customized Content”_****so the Customized Content can no longer be modified. Click OK to create a copy, make any changes, and then click “Create” to save****it!""**
    * If a teacher does not want to proceed with changes they will click the Cancel button (in top right corner of the pop-up).
    * If “Ok” button is clicked, the teacher is taken to a **copy** of the original Customized Content so the user can make any changes and then click “Create.”

There is much debate and strong feelings in our nation about how to identify various groups. At Studies Weekly, we work to create and nurture an inclusive environment. To ensure that we write about indigenous people using language that is not offensive, we consulted several sources. First,  states that the term 'American Indian' is more appropriate. It claims that the expression, 'Native American,' has fallen out of popularity. In the Native Times and Native Sun News, tribal journalists state that the term 'Native American' was thrust upon them by a white activist and does not reflect their desires. Whenever possible, they like to be identified by the tribe. For generalized references, they prefer to be called 'American Indian.'
Part of our rationale is also to be in alignment with the federal government of the United States of America. To be officially recognized by the federal government, the tribe has to have a political relationship with the U.S. government. When a tribe has that legal status, then it is known as an American Indian tribe with the power to self-govern as a separate nation. If the tribe is not federally recognized, then it is known as Native American. In summation, all American tribal members can be called Native Americans, but it is a higher and more prestigious status to be called an American Indian.

#  Rostering and Integration FAQs 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
While each rostering method comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, there are general rules that apply to each rostering method within Studies Weekly Online. These questions and answers will hopefully address concerns you may currently have when considering rostering with Studies Weekly.
What is Rostering?
Rostering with Studies Weekly allows districts to create and manage user accounts for teachers and students district wide through a variety of automated processes. Studies Weekly is also able to integrate roster data through third-party applications, such as ClassLink or Clever to allow Single Sign On with these applications. 
User data that is sent through the roster will be given a Studies Weekly Online account and be assigned either a district admin, teacher, or student role. 
If a family email is being shared with a student account in the district SIS, that email will also be linked to the student's Studies Weekly Online account. 
Why would I choose to roster my teachers and students?
As a District Admin that manages the roster data for your district, you will have the ability to manage the user accounts for all users at your district that utilize the Studies Weekly materials you’ve purchased. If you have a lot of users at your school, you can help them get a head start on the school year by setting up their online accounts for them. You can easily transfer classrooms from one teacher to another, remove unused student or teacher accounts, and see high-level usage reports for your district (broken down by school).
Do I have to roster my users?
No, if you would rather allow your teachers to manage their own classrooms and students, you can direct them to the registration page where they can create their own accounts. The teachers will have the option to create their student accounts in bulk using a variety of methods explained in this article:[How to Add Students to Your Classroom](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/5088800547611)
The teacher registration page can be found here: [Teacher Registration Page](https://online.studiesweekly.com/register#TeacherTab)
What options do you have for automated rostering?
We offer integrations with third-party applications such as ClassLink or Clever, Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) with CSV formatted files, or a direct connection with your Student Information System (SIS) through OneRoster API. 
How often are you able to sync data?
Studies Weekly will sync data each night to ensure we have the latest information. Studies Weekly is also able to sync upon request as well. Users with district administrator accounts can request a sync by following the instructions in this article:[Manual Sync of District Roster](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/30001674591003)
Do you offer Single Sign-On (SSO)?
Yes, we offer Single Sign-On through OAuth 2.0 Handshake, Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) by IMS Global, or Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).
Could we use Studies Weekly with a Learning Management System?
Yes, once we have set up a roster connection and we have users in the database, those who have an account will be able to login using an LMS. An LMS such as Google Classroom, Canvas, or Schoology gives teachers the opportunity to post lessons, assign homework, administer assessments, and communicate with students.
What LMSs do you integrate with?
Studies Weekly Online can integrate with any LMS that is compatible with LTI 1.0/1.1/1.2/1.3 Advantage.
This is the current list of LMS platforms that we have successfully integrated with: 
  * Canvas
  * Schoology
  * It's Learning
  * Blackboard Learn
  * Agilix Buzz
  * Thrivist Curve
  * Lesson Planet
  * Safari Montage
  * Infinite Campus Learning Suite


What can and cannot be manually edited within a rostered school?
Rostered users **can** do the following:
  * Add and remove publications from the classrooms created through rostering
    * If a publication is manually added, it will remain in the classroom during the sync
    * If a publication is manually removed, it will stay hidden during the sync
  * Create new classrooms not managed by the rostering sync


Rostered users **cannot** do the following inside classrooms created by rostering integrations:
  * Archive Classrooms
  * Add Co-Teachers
  * Add Students
  * Use the Join Code to Invite Students
  * Edit Student Name, Username, or Password
  * Transfer Students
  * Import Google Classroom Students
  * Create Multiple Students
  * Import Student
  * Generate Student Join Codes


Note
This means that they won’t see the three dots / action menu ![Three_dots.png](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/10278279957275) to perform these actions (e.g., on the Classroom tile).
What will happen to our existing accounts?
**If you are not using an automated rostering integration with Studies Weekly,** then account continuity is based on the email of the existing account. If the roster user's email matches the existing email, then the roster-provided account will be merged into the existing account. If no email match is found, an entirely new account will be created in Studies Weekly Online. Any existing accounts not matching an email from the roster data will not be affected.
Any classrooms in already existing accounts will remain active until they are archived manually. Entirely new classrooms will be created from the roster data that will not have any progress from students. 
Will account progress and reports merge to the new accounts?
New rostered accounts will merge with existing accounts if the email of the rostered account matches the existing account. Otherwise, a new account will be created that will have no access to existing data.
How long will it take for accounts to be created?
We have a pretty quick turnaround time. Once you share your roster data with us we can get the accounts created within 24 hours.
How do family accounts get created and how will they login?
Teachers can manually add a family email to a student account under the Edit Student section of the People page by following the instructions in this article:
[How To Edit Student Accounts](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/5294959965339)
This allows a parent or guardian view-only access to the student's account. 
Can our school roster or can rostering only be done at the district level?
If your school is independent from the district (your Student Information System(SIS) is independent from the district or the district does not include your school or any of it's users in rostering), then Studies Weekly can set up your school to roster. If not, then rostering must be done at the district level.
Can we roster after the school year has started?
Yes, you may still set up an automated rostering integration even if the schools in your district are already in session. However, since existing account data does not necessarily merge to new rostered accounts, your teachers and students may lose progress in their online publications if they have already been utilizing the materials through manually created accounts. Depending on how far you are into the school year, it will be up to you as the district to decide if you would like to roster now or wait until the next school year begins.
Can I use Google Classroom if my account is rostered?
If the email associated with your rostered account is the same as the user's Google Classroom email, then you will be able to use Google Classroom with Studies Weekly Online.

#  How To Use the Highlighting Tool 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Students can highlight text and media (images, videos, audio) and add notes in their publications. If a student highlights a word or phrase that is listed as a weekly vocabulary word, they will be able to read and listen to the definition. Highlights can be made in Articles, text and media sections, Activities, Customized Content, and Explore More.
To add highlights and notes, students will choose the article they would like to read.
iPad Users:
If using an iPad, you can highlight text by placing your finger on the first word you want to highlight. Hold it until the word turns blue, then drag your finger across the remaining words you want to highlight. Once you release your finger the blue selection bubbles appear. Do not lift your finger until all the text you want to highlight has been selected. The following steps in the process are the same as they would be on a computer.
To view vocabulary definitions, add highlights, or add notes, students will choose the article they would like to read.

  * **Add Image Note** : Click any article image to enlarge it. Select the **Highlight** button to write a note.![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31269869368219)


  * **Add Video Note** : Select a video from the publication or inside Explore More. Then find the highlighter button.

  5. Weekly vocabulary words and phrases are found within the articles. Students can read and listen to the definition of a vocabulary word or phrase, after it is highlighted. The definition also appears in the bottom of the dialog box. Vocabulary definitions can be disabled by teachers under the [Edit Students](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/5294959965339-How-To-Edit-Student-Accounts) tab from the People page.
  6. Click **SAVE** to record your notes and highlights.

#  How does Studies Weekly Integrate with LMSs? 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Many schools use a Learning Management System (LMS) to administer online learning. An LMS provides a more secure and controlled environment than a standard web browser. 
An LMS imports the school's roster to provision accounts and sets up classrooms. It gives teachers an interface to post lessons, assign homework, administer assessments, and communicate with students. It issues students their own user credentials so they can log in. It also allows users to view learning materials from content providers, such as Studies Weekly, without requiring different login credentials.
Studies Weekly integrates with several LMSs, including Canvas and Schoology. If you'd like to know if your district’s LMS can integrate with Studies Weekly and get it set up, please reach out to our team at .
**Instructional Presentations for setting up Canvas and Schoology**
Listed below are links to instructional presentations created to assist districts with getting Canvas and Schoology set up using LTI 1.3 Advantage. LTI 1.3 Advantage makes Deep Linking and Grade Passback compatible between Studies Weekly Online and your LMS platform.
**Thin Common Cartridge by IMS Global**
A common cartridge is an electronic file that contains the learning materials for a given course. Studies Weekly can provide its publications to schools that use an LMS in the form of a**thin common cartridge**. The thin common cartridge contains links to where learning materials are hosted on Studies Weekly’s website. This allows the cartridge files to remain small. It also provides a layer of security between the LMS application and the learning materials, which are hosted on the internet. This security is implemented through the LTI standard.
**Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) by IMS Global**
Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) is a standard that allows an LMS to securely communicate with a remote service provider like Studies Weekly. As the LMS communicates with a service provider, it can validate requests for content. To set up the LTI standard, Studies Weekly will provide the school with a consumer key and shared secret value. The LTI standard requires parties to use these values to digitally sign transmissions. This standard implements OAuth 1.0.

#  Rostering - Clever FAQs 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Click through the tabs below to see answers to commonly asked questions in regard to rostering with Clever.
**Is there a cost associated with rostering through Clever?**
Studies Weekly does not charge districts to roster with Clever. However, as with other third-party rostering services, we do require that publications have been purchased for your students and teachers so that they can fully utilize Studies Weekly Online. When a district requests Clever, we will check if the number of publications purchased justifies rostering the entire district through Clever, or if manually registering a few teachers and their classrooms would be a better option.
**Can non-teacher staff and administrator accounts be created through Clever rostering?**
Yes!
  * Users shared with Studies Weekly Online in the ""Staff"" section of Clever are given the [School Administrator](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/12909790796187) role in Studies Weekly Online.
  * Users shared with Studies Weekly Online in the ""District Administrator"" section of Clever are given the [District Administrator](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13277448223003) role in Studies Weekly Online. 


To add a user to the Clever roster as staff or admin, please reach out to Clever support.
**Can we use the Studies Weekly SSO application in Clever if we aren't rostered?**
Your district will need to be rostered in order to use the official Studies Weekly Online 3.0 SSO application in Clever. However, a custom application can be created in Clever with <https://online.studiesweekly.com/online/google> set as the shortcut URL. This will act as an SSO for users that have a Google-sourced email attached to their Studies Weekly Online account. 
Please Note
In order to use the Google SSO, please enable pop-ups on your internet browser. During the login process, a window will pop-up requesting you to select your account so that you can authenticate the login using your Google account.
If your users do not have Google-sourced emails, then you can set the custom application URL to be [online.studiesweekly.com](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/online.studiesweekly.com). That will take your users to the Studies Weekly Online login page.

This article presents what to do when a duplicate order has been placed and ways to prevent it.
Studies Weekly is not responsible for duplicate orders. If you place an order over the phone, please do not also fax, email, or mail the purchase order. This may result in a duplicate order being placed.
Important
If you receive a double shipment or two invoices for the same order with different invoice numbers, contact our [customer service department](https://www.studiesweekly.com/contact-us/) right away. Work with them to return and cancel the duplicate order, to avoid duplicate charges.
Studies Weekly is unable to accept returns after **February 1st**. That is the end of our shipping season and returns can no longer be used.

#  How To Create and Access Teacher Notes 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Teachers have the ability to highlight information, add notes, and embed Printables and Media (images, videos, and audio) when in Teacher Resources. This allows them to easily reference and review key information from the content and add it to a lesson plan. Notes and highlights are unique to a publication and will carry over to each classroom that has access to that publication within the user’s account.
Note
Notes and highlights can only be seen by the user who created them and will be saved to use year after year.

FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Studies Weekly Online recommends using the [Grade Section](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13879825760155) to score student submissions. However, teachers have the option to grade or view student submissions using the Table of Contents. Visit the printing tip at the bottom of this article for printing student responses and Answer Keys. 
From your [Studies Weekly Online](https://online.studiesweekly.com/) account and within the desired **Classroom Card** , click a publication to open it or click **View All Publications**. Once a publication has been selected, open **Unit** and **Week** , then click **Grade** : 
From the **Grade** tab, teachers can perform the following actions:
  1. Navigate to different content within the selected week. (In this example, Week 1: Government Assessment was clicked.) If you do not see the Navigation Bar on the left, you will need to zoom out. ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31114241655835)
  2. Use the **Graded** , **Not Turned In** , or **Ungraded** buttons to filter student submissions. **All** Students is the default view. ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31114241660315)

     * Teachers can also assign a retake by clicking the **Retake Button.****![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/24165947324059)**This will change the view to a**Submissions** section to be able to view each submission separately. To learn more about retakes, visit the article [How to Allow a Student to Retake a Submission](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/5088723863451-How-to-Allow-a-Student-to-Retake-a-Submission) and click the**Publication** tab.
     * Clicking the **three dots** ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/24165958994971)to the right of a student name, allows the teacher to **Edit** the student account or **Login As** the student. 
  4. After a student submission is selected, teachers will see the **Date** and **Time** , **Number of Submissions** ,**Coins** , and **Score** for the selected content. (In this example, Week 1: Government Assessment is selected for Sunny Day.) ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31114253659163)
     * A drop down box allows quick access to view **All** , **Needs to Be Graded** , **Incorrect** , **Correct** , or **Partially Correct responses**. 
     * Quickly change a student’s score from **Needs to Be Graded** by clicking the appropriate option; **Correct** , **Partially Correct** , or **Incorrect** , then click **Update Scores**.
     * The **Retake Not allowed** button can be clicked to change it to **Retake Allowed**. This allows the student another attempt at the selected content and will change the view to a **Submissions** page. Teachers will be able to view each attempt separately. 


**Printing an Answer Key or Student Submissions Tips**
Teachers are encouraged to use the [Answer Keys](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/16960761557915) found in the **Teacher Actions** dropdown, rather than try to create their own.
Student Submissions can be printed or saved as a PDF by opening the **Teachers Actions** dropdown and selecting **Print**. If the Print button is missing for a Student is indicates the student has not submitted the content.

In Explorers, students can customize their avatar and decorate a treehouse. The Explorers game is located in the student user profile menu in the top right corner of the screen. To access it, students will click their **Profile Menu** next to the notification bell, then select **Explorers**.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/38338598283803)
**Customize the Avatar**
Coins are not required to customize the avatar and changes can be made anytime by clicking the default avatar in the top left corner of the screen.

**Decorate the Treehouse**
As students progress in Studies Weekly Online by completing learning activities, they earn coins. As students earn coins, the progress bar in the upper left corner will fill in.

Gems can be used to make special purchases in the Treasure Box.

#  How to Monitor Student Article Questions 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Teachers may choose to monitor student completion of the assigned comprehension questions at the end of Articles within Publications. Article questions are designed to help students learn how to identify evidence from the reading to support a claim.*****
Student responses are automatically graded by Studies Weekly Online and they receive immediate feedback. Students have unlimited chances to select the correct response, but they are incentivized with coins to correctly answer each question in as few attempts as possible.******
Studies Weekly Online reports reflect this and provide teachers with student progress toward **_completion_** of the weekly article questions in multiple places.
**Gradebook Statistics Grade Tab**
The **Gradebook** provides a quick view of assigned items and the students assigned to the classroom. Use the dropdown boxes in the Gradebook to navigate to the publication, week, and item of your choice to view completion. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37643445771291)
For each student record a teacher will see one of the following for article questions: 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/21143960634267) **Not Started** : The student has not started the item.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/21143960656411) **In Progress** : The student has begun the item but has not completed it. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/21143960688027) **Completed** : The student completed the article questions. Scores are not shown for article questions since they must get the questions correct before moving on.
**![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/15093245132187)** **Number of submissions** : This will show the total number of attempts on an item. When you click a number you will see the date and time of each submission. When you click a submission you will see the student’s answer.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/28114546634779)
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37643456362395)
To learn about the additional symbols and more features in the Gradebook, visit the [How to Navigate the Grade Section](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13879825760155-How-to-Navigate-the-Grade-Section) article. 
Statistics can be found inside the Snapshot Report and in Table of Contents of publications. Statistics allow teachers to quickly check student completion of article questions.
**Snapshot Report**
The Snapshot Report is found under Reports and will show your student's statistics on comprehension questions. You must first select a Publication, Week, and Content:
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37643445779099)
When a question is selected, teachers will see a graph of the answers students chose. Below the graph, teachers will see the individual attempts by each student. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31113135814683)
**Table of Contents**
Statistics are also found after selecting a week in the Table of Contents. This will show you a Class Overview for the Article. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37643456368283)
Selecting a question within the Article, will show statistics for that question exactly as in the Snapshot Report. 
Statistics can also be used to view Activities, Crossword, Misspilled, and Assessments. To learn how to view student statistics, visit the [How to Navigate the Snapshot Report](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13496345220763-How-to-Navigate-the-Snapshot-Report) article.
The Table of Contents are found after opening a publication and selecting a week. To view completion of Article questions select the **Grade** tab. This action will show colored chips indicating the totals of the number of students in the class (**All**), the total **Graded** , **Not Turned In** , and **Ungraded**. These colored chips correlate with the list of enrolled students directly below. This allows teachers to quickly see who has not completed the comprehension questions for the selected Article. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31113135817627)
To learn more about navigating the **Grade** tab visit the [How to Grade Student Submissions from the Table of Contents](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/17586872714779-How-to-Grade-Student-Submissions-from-the-Table-of-Contents) article.
Note
***** Answers to comprehension questions are found within the articles and students are encouraged to go back to the Article to find the answer with every incorrect response.

#  How does Studies Weekly select terms to describe race or ethnicity? 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
One of the most significant challenges that we face is to write publications that use inclusive terminology. We strive to use language that is acceptable to all races, nationalities, ethnicities, and diverse groups.
We take this responsibility seriously because teachers and students across the country use our publications. To ensure inclusive and respectful terminology, we refer to reliable sources for guidance.
We follow the Associated Press (AP) Stylebook guidelines. The AP Stylebook is considered the industry standard and leading reference for public communications. We have also assembled a Diversity Board to review content for cultural sensitivity. They also assist with using proper word choice in our publications.
Using the right terminology can be a challenge. We are diligent in adjusting to the appropriate language as cultural identification evolves. Studies Weekly respects all individuals and seeks to recognize each heritage appropriately. We welcome your partnership in using proper terminology as we strive to improve our publications, old and new.

#  How Teachers Assign District Customized Content 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
District administrators have the ability to create and share District Customized Content with teachers across the district. 
Once District Customized Content has been shared, teachers will need to assign it to their class(es) before it will appear in the teacher’s **Customized Content** list and in their student’s **To Do** list. 
Teachers will also have access to see student scores for the District Customized Content in the **Customized Content Report**.
The instructions below will walk teachers through the steps.
**Assign and View**
Teachers will receive an email and a notification in the upper right corner of their Studies Weekly Account Dashboard when District-Created Customized Content is shared with them. The content is not automatically assigned to classrooms or students. Teachers will do that in a follow-up step. After teachers assign District Customized Content to their class(es), they will be able to review the content and read the separate instructions for students and teachers. 
Click the **Notification Bell** to view the shared District Customized Content. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/26850723262875)
Select the content shared by the district admin to assign it to your class(es).
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/26850769464987)
As soon as the District Customized Content is selected, the **Classrooms** page opens. Follow the on-screen instructions and select the class(es) to assign the content. 
Make sure to select the appropriate class(s) then click **Add**.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/26850723282459)
Once the **Add** button is selected, a confirmation box appears on-screen and will now be available in your Customized Content list. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/26850776055323)
Teachers will be able to see (as shown below) which content they have created and which content has been created by a district admin. Click the **title** to view the District Customized Content. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/27519496030491)
**Edit**
When District Customized Content is created, admins have the option to allow teachers to edit the content and due dates. If the district admin selects this option, teachers will be able to make changes to content and due dates for their class(es). 
If editing has been enabled by the district admin, teachers will be able to click the **Edit** button in the **Actions Menu**. If **Edit** is grayed out, teachers will not be able to make changes.
To edit District Customized Content, click the **three dots**![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/26850723302683) in the bottom right corner of the label for the content you wish to edit.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/26851085566875)
Make the necessary edits and click **Save** at the bottom of the screen.
If you have never edited or created Customized Content before, visit the [How to Create Customized Content](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/4861136293787-How-to-Create-Customized-Content) article and select the **Edit Already Created Customized Content** tab.
**View Scores**
Teachers will see student scores for District Customized Content in the **Customized Content Report**. If you are new to using the Customized Content Report, visit the [How to Use the Customized Content Report](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/10331315717787-How-to-Use-the-Customized-Content-Report) article. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/26851530296219)
**Grade**
Teachers will be able to grade student responses, if that option was chosen when the District Customized Content was created. Otherwise, the content is automatically graded by Studies Weekly Online. 
If grading is required, teachers will receive a notification with a link to the student submission(s).
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/26851397322523)
Select the link to view the submission. This will open **Quick Grade,** teachers will see all the student submissions that need to be graded. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/26851443264923)
If you are new to grading student work, visit the [How to Navigate the Grade Section](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13879825760155-How-to-Navigate-the-Grade-Section) article.

#  What SSO’s are compatible with Studies Weekly Online? 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Single Sign-On (SSO) is a service that allows you to use one set of login credentials to access multiple websites. Studies Weekly has SSO options that make it easier for users to log in.
On the login page for Studies Weekly Online, you’ll see options to log in with Google, ClassLink, or Clever.
  * **Google SSO:** For our users who have an email address hosted by Google (e.g., Gmail), we are able to provide SSO as an option for logging in to Studies Weekly Online. Password resets should not happen on Studies Weekly’s site as the credentials used to authenticate are the ones set through your Google account.
  * **ClassLink or Clever SSO:** Users will be able to access their ClassLink or Clever teacher or student portal to launch Studies Weekly and be authenticated into their Studies Weekly accounts. This eliminates the need for teachers and students from accessing one more URL during their busy day of learning.

Click each tab to learn more about the SSOs that are compatible with Studies Weekly Online.
**OAuth 2.0 Handshake**
OAuth 2.0 is another secure protocol that allows service providers to trust authentication assertions from an identity provider. It provides methods for a user to set different levels of trust and information transfer as well as revoke previously granted permissions. Google and Facebook implement this type of authentication security. Studies Weekly can establish this protocol with your identity provider.
**Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) by IMS Global**
IMS Global has created its own standard for securely communicating and sharing an authentication assertion between an identity provider and a service provider. Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) uses the OAuth 1.0 protocol to digitally sign requests to access content from a service provider. Studies Weekly can issue a consumer key and a shared secret value that LTI-enabled applications can use to securely sign and transmit requests.
**Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)**
SAML is a protocol for securely communicating between a service provider and an identity provider. Studies Weekly uses SAML 2.0 to broker communication, securely transmit data, and validate authentication assertions. Studies Weekly can create a custom SAML consumer endpoint to which your identity provider can direct security assertions. As most schools use identity provider systems that provide links to service providers on a central dashboard or launch panel, Studies Weekly prefers to use an identity-provider-initiated one-way login assertion SAML workflow.

#  How to Access and Navigate Teacher Resources 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Each Studies Weekly Online publication has **Teacher Resources** to support educators utilizing our materials and tailor classes to meet student needs. Teacher Resources can include a Scope and Sequence, Standards Correlation, lesson plans, vocabulary lists, printables, standards, media, and additional resources. Available resources can vary from one publication to another. This article covers how to locate the **Teacher Resources** button and navigate the resources within.
The **Teacher Edition** is a PDF document that can be found within the **Teacher Resources** or a publication.
Access Navigating Teacher Resources 
Teachers can access helpful resources from the **Teacher Resources** button in the Table of Contents or while viewing content within a week.
From your [Studies Weekly Online](https://online.studiesweekly.com/) account, open the publication you wish to find resources for and select the **Teacher Resources** button from the Table of Contents. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37613913028891)
That opens the**Teacher Resources** tab within the content for the week.
From there, teachers can view different sections using the quick links or scrolling down to view available resources for the Article/Activity, Week/Lesson, Unit, and Publication.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37719024350491)
Each section can have supplemental resources available and will vary from publication to publication. (Your assigned state under **Account Settings** must match the state of the publication to view the standards.) 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37753331056283)
To preview a digital PDF, select the red PDF button. ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37753368152347) This also allows you to assign it via creating a Customized Content activity or sharing the link using Google Classroom.
Selecting the print option for digital PDFs, will open them in a new browser tab. For best print quality, make sure to check the boxes for **Headers and Footers** as well as **Background graphics** in your printer settings. To learn about printing, visit the [How to Print Studies Weekly Online Materials](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/18385714221723-How-to-Print-Studies-Weekly-Online-Materials) article.
The **Standards Correlation** and **Scope and Sequence** are accessible in the Publication Resources section when the user's state matches the state indicated in the publication. Visit the [Scope and Sequence and Standards Correlation](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/31727978021531-Scope-and-Sequence-and-Standards-Correlation) to learn more.
Teacher Edition PDF
***** Teachers can also access the weekly Student and Teacher Edition PDFs within the Teacher Resources. The Teacher Edition PDF contains the lesson plans for the week and may also contain Answer Keys. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37719011486363)If available, buttons to open the PDFs will be shown in the same place. After selecting a PDF, it will open in a new browser tab where it can be downloaded or printed. 
The Teacher Edition and Student Edition PDFs are not always available.
Success
When viewing the Teacher Resources on a smaller screen (e.g., on a tablet or smartphone), you may need to scroll down to see the content.

The objective of Misspilled is for students to determine if words are spelled correctly or incorrectly. 
![Misspilled_Main.png](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/9768354079387)
Students drag words that are spelled incorrectly to the red liquid on the left. Words that are spelled correctly should go to the green liquid on the right.
![Misspilled_Game.png](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/9768357358235)
Students can also earn coins by completing the Misspilled vocabulary review in a certain amount of time. Students earn a gold, silver, or bronze based on how long they take to complete it. 
![Misspilled_Results.png](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/9768411094427)
See the [How to Earn Coins](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/6941068617627-Coins) article for a full breakdown of how many coins a student can earn.

#  OneRoster API - Troubleshooting 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
This article covers some of our most common questions we receive from OneRoster API users. Additional questions can be directed to .
**Why isn't the student I added to the roster able to log in?**
Was the student added to the roster server and shared to Studies Weekly or were they just added to the SIS roster? Also, we sync your roster data on a nightly basis. Was the student added to the roster after last night's sync? From your admin account, can you see if the most recent sync was successful or is it showing up as failed? If your sync is failing, reach out to rostering@studiesweekly.com
**Why can't our teachers invite co-teachers into their classroom?**
Teachers, students, and classrooms created through automated rostering can only be updated through the roster. If a rostered teacher tries to invite a rostered or unrostered teacher to their rostered classroom, they will not be able to join. They will need to be added as a co-teacher of the classroom on the roster.
**Why do my students see classes in their account that aren't associated with Studies Weekly?**
Depending on the type of roster server the district is using, your district may be unable to filter out data from the SIS when we sync your roster each night. If they have the ability to, the district roster admin should filter out any teachers, students, and classrooms that aren't utilizing Studies Weekly Online.
Troubleshooting Help
If these specific questions and examples did not address your issue, please reach out to rostering@studiesweekly.com.

#  How to Use LMS Deep Linking as a Teacher 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Studies Weekly Online content can be embedded in both Canvas and Schoology LMSs using deep linking. Deep linking uses a hyperlink to connect the user directly to a piece of web content, like a specific Studies Weekly Assessment. To access deep linking, a paid Root Administrator must first set it up. Contact your administrator or district IT for help.
From the district LMS, teachers will start the **Deeplink Selection Mode**. This sends an LTI message that informs Studies Weekly Online that teachers are entering our site and it will automatically launch. Adjust the window size to ensure visibility, then navigate to the content you want to share. 
All content, including Customized Content, Explore More Media, and Search results, can be shared with deep linking. 
**Deeplink Selection Mode from Canvas**
Teachers should already have an understanding of navigating Canvas before proceeding. When following the steps in Canvas to deep link an Assignment or Module, be sure to set the Submission Type as**External Tool.**
  * Choose **Studies Weekly** (Studies Weekly LTI 1.3/Advantage), then click **Select** to choose the Studies Weekly content. ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/35622299770011)
  * Studies Weekly Online will open in a pop-up module. Navigate to the desired content page and select **Click to Share Deeplink**.![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/35622299771803)
  * Then the Configure External Tool modal will appear, choose **Select** to insert the Studies weekly link into your Canvas Assignment.
  * Follow the remaining steps in Canvas to **Save and Publish**.


**Deeplink Selection Mode from Schoology**
Teachers should already have an understanding of navigating Schoology before proceeding. When following the steps in Schoology to deep link, navigate to the Materials tab and select **Add Material**. 
From the dropdown menu, select **Studies Weekly LTI Advantage (LTI v1p3)**.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/35622299776283)
Follow the remaining steps to choose Studies Weekly Online content and Schoology to **Save**. 
Note
If you do not see Studies Weekly LTI available in the menu, please reach out to your IT administrator for additional support.
Important
These steps may look different in other LMSs.

#  Rostering - ClassLink FAQs 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Click through the tabs below to see answers to commonly asked questions in regard to rostering with ClassLink.
**Is there a cost associated with rostering through ClassLink?**
Studies Weekly does not charge districts to roster with ClassLink. However, as with other third-party rostering services, we require that publications be purchased for your students and teachers so they can fully utilize Studies Weekly Online.
**Can non-teacher staff and administrator accounts be created through ClassLink rostering?**
Yes, Studies Weekly Online does support staff and administrators shared through the ClassLink roster. Users with the ""administrator"" role in your OneRoster data will be given the [District Administrator](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13277448223003) role in Studies Weekly Online.
Users with the ""Aide"" or ""Proctor"" roles in the OneRoster data are assigned to standard teacher accounts in Studies Weekly Online.
**Which Studies Weekly SSO application should I download from the Global Application Library in ClassLink?**
The Studies Weekly Online 3.0 Oauth2 application, with the blue Studies Weekly logo, is our most up-to-date SSO application.
**What will happen to our existing accounts?**
**If you are already using an automated rostering integration with Studies Weekly** , then Studies Weekly Online will determine account continuity based on the sourcedId and email fields of your shared OneRoster user records. If the user has the same email OR sourcedId in their new ClassLink OneRoster record as in their already existing record, then the ClassLink rostering integration will seamlessly merge into the existing account. If both the sourcedId and email fields for the new record are different, a new account will be created for the user, and the old account will be disabled.
**If you are not using an automated rostering integration with Studies Weekly,** then account continuity is solely based off of the email of the existing account. If the new OneRoster record's email matches the existing email, then the ClassLink account will be merged into the existing account. Otherwise, a new account will be created. Any existing accounts not matching an email from the OneRoster records will not be affected.
**Will existing data merge to new accounts?**
Existing data will merge into new accounts if the account has a matching email OR sourcedID. If not, then the new account will not retain any data from the old account.
**How do non-teacher accounts get created, and how will those users log in?**
Studies Weekly accommodates non-primary teachers enrolled in additional classrooms in your OneRoster records. The additional teachers will have the same access to the classroom as the primary teacher. OneRoster aides and proctors are given the teacher role in Studies Weekly Online. OneRoster administrators are given the ""district administrator"" role in Studies Weekly Online. Non-admin users must be enrolled in the class they wish to access in Studies Weekly Online. If they do not have an enrollment record for the class, it will not be accessible from their account. Even if they are not enrolled in any rostered classes, your users can access Studies Weekly Online and manually create a test classroom to access the online publications.
Rostered users will sign in to Studies Weekly Online either by entering from the SWO 3.0 Application within ClassLink or using the ""LOG IN WITH CLASSLINK"" button on our login page. Users with manually created accounts will have to sign in using their credentials at the standard login page.
**When should we begin this process to be ready for activation?**
Once your district has added the Studies Weekly Online application to ClassLink and enabled roster sharing, we can change your roster configuration to use ClassLink and sync the new data immediately. This can be done at any time, but we recommend that it be done at least a week before the accounts and classrooms are needed so that we can make sure that everything is working without issue.

Users with manually created accounts will have to sign in using their credentials at the standard login page. **When should we begin this process to be ready for activation?** Once your district has added the Studies Weekly Online application to ClassLink and enabled roster sharing, we can change your roster configuration to use ClassLink and sync the new data immediately. This can be done at any time, but we recommend that it be done at least a week before the accounts and classrooms are needed so that we can make sure that everything is working without issue.

#  Understanding Question Types 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
There are many question types that students may encounter while navigating Studies Weekly Online. Teachers may use these question types while creating Customized Content. The options below will provide an explanation of the item types. 
If you are new to creating Customized Content, please review the following articles before proceeding. [How to Navigate the Customized Content Page](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/5469286703515-How-to-Navigate-the-Customized-Content-Page) and [How to Create Customized Content](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/4861136293787-How-to-Create-Customized-Content).
To see the 5 categories of question types, select the **+****Add** button from the Create Customized Content page,
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/34942583473179)
All question types have the same formatting options representing. Bold, Italic, Underline, Heading, Bullet Points, Numbered List, Undo, Redo, Add an Image.

Question type options are automatically graded by Studies Weekly Online when the students submit their responses, with the exception of Open Response, Grouping, and Drawing Tool.
  * **True or False** questions are used to determine whether a student can identify if a statement is true or false.
  * **Open Response** is used to ask students to respond with a written answer. These questions must be graded by a teacher, and instructions for grading can be found in the [How to Navigate the Grade Section](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13879825760155-How-to-Navigate-the-Grade-Section) article.
  * **Sorting** questions are a great option for questions where the answers need to be in a particular order such as a timeline of events or sequence of scientific steps.
  * **Numeric** questions allow teachers to add a math problem.
  * **Multiple Choice** are the most commonly found question type throughout the program. To create your own, you will need to create at least two preset answer options to save your question. Otherwise, you can add as many answer options as you would like. 
  * **Fill In the Blank** / **Inline Choice** questions are statements that require students to fill in a blank space by choosing the correct answer from a **Dropdown** list, **Text Answer** , or write an **Open-Ended Response**. These questions can have varying levels of difficulty for all development levels. There should be a clear correct and incorrect choice to eliminate guessing, providing accurate representations of student understanding. 
  * **Grouping** questions are ideal for Venn Diagrams and require students to drag and drop answers into the correct group. 
  * **Hot Spot** questions require students to click a specific part or parts of an image to answer a question. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/15527064098075-Hot-Spot-Question-Type).
  * **Hot Text** requires students to click a specific part or parts of a text to answer a question. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/34831335242395-Hot-Text-Question-Type).
  * **Check All That Apply** / **Multiselect** are similar to Multiple Choice except students can select more than one answer. These questions require possible selections to be absolutely true or absolutely false. This option would be ideal in situations like asking students to identify which animals are carnivores or which presidents served 2 terms.
  * **Matching** questions are engaging and require students to pair images or statements in one column to images or statements in another column. For instance, students can match animals with their natural habitats or dates with important historical events. 
  * **Labeling** questions require students to drag and drop text labels onto different parts of an image. These are especially useful for science and geography images.
  * **Drawing Tool** allows teachers to use a Studies Weekly image, a blank canvas, or upload their own image (coming soon). Students will reply to the prompt using a digital pen, paint brushes, and other tools. These questions must be graded by a teacher. Instructions for grading can be found in the [How to Navigate the Grade Section](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13879825760155-How-to-Navigate-the-Grade-Section) article.


Select**Item** from the category list to open the modal to select the question type you want to add:
  * **Text** allows you to add any passage you would like your students to read. You can also attach an image and bullet points using the formatting options. (This item type will not allow students to earn coins.) 
  * **Crosswords** are a fun way to incorporate vocabulary terms. A minimum of three terms are required to create a Crossword. 
  * **Article** allows teachers to attach any Studies Weekly Online Article as Customized Content. This is ideal when you want students to highlight specific parts in the text or come to class ready to discuss what they read. (This item type will not allow students to earn coins.) Teachers can edit text and remove images within the Article Block modal before saving. 
  * **External Resources** allows teachers to share external resources as Customized Content. Some examples include publicly available internet videos, images, and other sites that do not require a login. External uploads will have a name credit under the image and display as Uploaded by [Last Name].
  * **Media** gives teachers the option to include a Studies Weekly Online image, audio recording, video, or document. (This item type will not allow students to earn coins.) See also the Upload Images tab.
  * **Lesson Walkthroughs** can be added as Customized Content for students to have quick access to media or text from Studies Weekly Lesson Walkthroughs.

[General FAQs](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/sections/6510676842651-General-FAQs) Understanding Question Types FollowNot yet followed by anyone There are many question types that students may encounter while navigating Studies Weekly Online. Teachers may use these question types while creating Customized Content. The options below will provide an explanation of the item types. If you are new to creating Customized Content, please review the following articles before proceeding. [How to Navigate the Customized Content Page](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/5469286703515-How-to-Navigate-the-Customized-Content-Page) and [How to Create Customized Content](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/4861136293787-How-to-Create-Customized-Content). To see the 5 categories of question types, select the **+****Add** button from the Create Customized Content page, ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/34942583473179) All question types have the same formatting options representing. Bold, Italic, Underline, Heading, Bullet Points, Numbered List, Undo, Redo, Add an Image. ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/34942583476891) **Read more info about uploading an image in the tab of this article titled Upload Images.** Question Item Digital Printable Question Bank Add Previously Created Customized Content Upload Images Question type options are automatically graded by Studies Weekly Online when the students submit their responses, with the exception of Open Response, Grouping, and Drawing Tool. * **True or False** questions are used to determine whether a student can identify if a statement is true or false. * **Open Response** is used to ask students to respond with a written answer. These questions must be graded by a teacher, and instructions for grading can be found in the [How to Navigate the Grade Section](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13879825760155-How-to-Navigate-the-Grade-Section) article. * **Sorting** questions are a great option for questions where the answers need to be in a particular order such as a timeline of events or sequence of scientific steps. * **Numeric** questions allow teachers to add a math problem. * **Multiple Choice** are the most commonly found question type throughout the program. To create your own, you will need to create at least two preset answer options to save your question. Otherwise, you can add as many answer options as you would like. * **Fill In the Blank** / **Inline Choice** questions are statements that require students to fill in a blank space by choosing the correct answer from a **Dropdown** list, **Text Answer** , or write an **Open-Ended Response**. These questions can have varying levels of difficulty for all development levels. There should be a clear correct and incorrect choice to eliminate guessing, providing accurate representations of student understanding. * **Grouping** questions are ideal for Venn Diagrams and require students to drag and drop answers into the correct group. * **Hot Spot** questions require students to click a specific part or parts of an image to answer a question. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/15527064098075-Hot-Spot-Question-Type). * **Hot Text** requires students to click a specific part or parts of a text to answer a question. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/34831335242395-Hot-Text-Question-Type). * **Check All That Apply** / **Multiselect** are similar to Multiple Choice except students can select more than one answer. These questions require possible selections to be absolutely true or absolutely false. This option would be ideal in situations like asking students to identify which animals are carnivores or which presidents served 2 terms. * **Matching** questions are engaging and require students to pair images or statements in one column to images or statements in another column. For instance, students can match animals with their natural habitats or dates with important historical events. * **Labeling** questions require students to drag and drop text labels onto different parts of an image. These are especially useful for science and geography images. * **Drawing Tool** allows teachers to use a Studies Weekly image, a blank canvas, or upload their own image (coming soon). Students will reply to the prompt using a digital pen, paint brushes, and other tools. These questions must be graded by a teacher. Instructions for grading can be found in the [How to Navigate the Grade Section](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13879825760155-How-to-Navigate-the-Grade-Section) article. Select**Item** from the category list to open the modal to select the question type you want to add: * **Text** allows you to add any passage you would like your students to read. You can also attach an image and bullet points using the formatting options. (This item type will not allow students to earn coins.) * **Crosswords** are a fun way to incorporate vocabulary terms. A minimum of three terms are required to create a Crossword. * **Article** allows teachers to attach any Studies Weekly Online Article as Customized Content. This is ideal when you want students to highlight specific parts in the text or come to class ready to discuss what they read. (This item type will not allow students to earn coins.) Teachers can edit text and remove images within the Article Block modal before saving. * **External Resources** allows teachers to share external resources as Customized Content. Some examples include publicly available internet videos, images, and other sites that do not require a login. External uploads will have a name credit under the image and display as Uploaded by [Last Name]. * **Media** gives teachers the option to include a Studies Weekly Online image, audio recording, video, or document. (This item type will not allow students to earn coins.) See also the Upload Images tab. * **Lesson Walkthroughs** can be added as Customized Content for students to have quick access to media or text from Studies Weekly Lesson Walkthroughs. Teachers must select **Confirm** to create a copy of the original Studies Weekly Online content before making changes. Then follow the onscreen steps to create their Customized content.![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/34942583479707) Digital Printables allow students to interact with a printable created by Studies Weekly. Students will be able to do the following: * Free draw with a pen, brush, or highlighter (with color options). * Add basic shapes (with color and size options). * Add text (with font, color, and size options). * Highlight (with color options). * Earn coins. ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31963592638235) For detailed instructions visit the [Digital Printable Question Type](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/24705559700379-Digital-Printable-Question-Type) article.

Apply (optional) filters to display All, Articles, Activities, or Assessments. 4. **Select All Checkbox** will insert all of the questions into your Customized Content. 5. Select individual checkboxes next to questions you want to add or remove (these can be edited later using the red **X**). 6. Click **Add** to save your questions. Or, if you want to add additional questions from a second source, hold off and selecting **Add**. Instead from here, choose a new publication, or area in the Table of Contents dropdown. Your progress will not be lost. ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31963600679707) **Point Value** and **Color** options can be adjusted before your final **Save.** This feature allows teachers to retrieve Customized Content they previously created in a different classroom or content a co-teacher has created in a shared classroom. This can be accomplished several ways. To explore each option visit the [How to Add Previously Created Customized Content](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/8423353400475-How-to-Add-Previously-Created-Customized-Content) article. Teachers can add or upload images from their device into their Customized Content. There are 2 ways to make this happen. 1. Using the **Add Image** button in the formatting options of all question types to upload/add an image within the Question box. Type your text in the box first, then add/upload your image with the **Add Image** button. ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31963592665627) 2.

#  Navigating Student Notes 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Students can quickly access their notes and highlights in assigned publications. The **Notes** tab will include saved highlights (in the students selected color) and any notes they typed and saved within the publication.
There are two ways students can access their saved Notes.
From your [Studies Weekly Online](https://online.studiesweekly.com/) account, click the **Notes** button under the name of the classroom you wish to enter. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31267748994971)
In Notes, students will be able to select the following items: ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/38793607784475)
  1. **Publication Dropdown:** Switch between assigned publications. If a student only has one publication assigned, they will not be able to use this feature. If a student did not create highlights or notes, they will see “There are no highlights or notes for this publication.” ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/14014171463963)
  2. **Search bar:** Search highlighted text and annotations made by the student.
  3. **Filter by Unit or Week** : The default view is the entire publication, but students can use the filters to jump to a specific unit or week within the selected publication.
  4. **Article, Week and Unit Labels:** Hyperlinks will take the student to that part of the publication in their current classroom. There students can edit, delete, or create new notes and highlights.
  5. **Print button** : A printer friendly version of the student's highlights and notes.


Note
Teachers may wish to view this feature as a student. To do so, teachers will click on the **Student View** of a publication.

Co-teachers will have the same level of access and permissions as primary teachers. This includes being able to change the week order, week visibility, and manage all aspects of the classroom. Co-teachers can also modify, grade, and change the availability for weekly assessments, Customized Content, and vocabulary reviews. Co-teachers _cannot_ remove other teachers or archive the classroom.

#  OneRoster API - Pros and Cons 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Pros Cons 

Direct Connection
    Instead of going through a third party like Clever or ClassLink, your district can connect with Studies Weekly directly by setting up a roster server through your Student Information System (SIS). 

Automated Roster Updates
    After we set up the API connection between your roster and Studies Weekly Online, your roster data will be scheduled to sync on a nightly basis. If you ever need to add or remove a teacher or student, change a class, or update the credentials on an account, these updates will be automatically processed during the nightly sync. 

Single Sign-On through Google
    If the teacher and student accounts are rostered using Google-sourced emails for the usernames of the accounts, you can quickly and easily access Studies Weekly Online without the need to memorize a username or password.After verifying their Google Account, students and teachers can use one of the following options to automatically log in each time:1. Go through our [Single Sign-on interface](https://online.studiesweekly.com/online/google)2. Go to [online.studiesweekly.com](https://online.studiesweekly.com/login) and select the **LOGIN WITH GOOGLE** button. 

Google Classroom
    After setting up teacher and student accounts with Google-sourced email addresses, teachers can utilize the Google Classroom integration in Studies Weekly Online. 

Unfiltered Data
    Depending on your Student Information System (SIS) and how your district rostering admin set up their internal roster server, you may be unable to filter the data you send to Studies Weekly Online. This means that accounts can potentially be created for everyone in the SIS, even users and classrooms that are not using the Studies Weekly publication. 

Limited Visibility
    When you share your roster directly with Studies Weekly Online or through a third party service such as ClassLink or Clever, Studies Weekly Customer Support Reps can view that roster, when needed, to assist with tech troubleshooting.     But with OneRoster API connections, Customer Support Reps can only see the accounts listed in Studies Weekly Online. In cases where you are sharing users but they don't appear in Studies Weekly Online, Customer Support cannot view your roster server to help with troubleshooting.

#  Studies Weekly CSV - Pro and Cons 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Pros Cons 

First Party Support
    Using the Studies Weekly CSV rostering service means you are working with a program that is developed and fully supported by Studies Weekly Online. With that, you can easily find helpful articles within this help center for setting up and troubleshooting your roster. Plus, we can more readily implement your feedback about improving the rostering process because we have full control over how the Studies Weekly CSV rostering process is handled, and are not working through a third party rostering system. 

Automated Rostering through FTP
    If your district is familiar with using a file transfer protocol (FTP) client and syncing that with the district Student Information System (SIS) data, then the rostering process through Studies Weekly CSV can be automated. This accommodates changes you make in your SIS, automatically generating new files and updating the FTP server that connects with Studies Weekly Online. Because Studies Weekly Online syncs all files on a nightly basis, your roster will be updated daily. 

Single Sign-On through Google
    If the teacher and student accounts are rostered using Google-sourced emails for the usernames of the accounts, you can quickly and easily access Studies Weekly Online without the need to memorize a username or password. After verifying their Google Account, students and teachers can use one of the following options to automatically log in each time:1. Go through our [Single Sign-on interface](https://online.studiesweekly.com/online/google) 2. Go to [online.studiesweekly.com](https://online.studiesweekly.com/login) and select the **LOGIN WITH GOOGLE** button. 

Google Classroom
    After setting up the teacher and student accounts with Google-sourced email addresses, the teachers can also utilize the Google Classroom integration in Studies Weekly Online. 

Maintain Rostered Accounts
    This is the only roster method that allows you to switch back to manual access without losing data. This lets teachers have control over adding and removing students and managing their online accounts. 

Updating Files Difficult for Manual Users
    If your district is not automating the roster using a file transfer protocol (FTP), then any time you need to add or remove a teacher, student, or classroom, you will need to re-upload all 5 CSV template files (schools.csv, teachers.csv, students.csv, classes.csv, student_class.csv). Even if the change is just for one student, all of these CSV files are needed because they designate how your roster connects to Studies Weekly Online.     _Please find more information about the CSV formats in this[Rostering explanation article](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/5317977142171-How-to-Navigate-Rostering-and-Integrations). _ 

Strict Formatting
    Your CSV template files need to follow the [formatting guidelines](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/5317977142171-How-to-Navigate-Rostering-and-Integrations) in order for the roster to sync successfully. While we continually make updates to make this formatting less strict, it is important to know that any blank rows, extra columns, duplicate users, and unmatching IDs in the files will cause the roster to sync incorrectly. 

Administrator Accounts
    Unlike other roster methods, administrator accounts cannot be created through Studies Weekly CSV rostering. We are working to change this, but for now, this must be done manually. Email our rostering team at with a list of the users that need district/school administrative access and we will create those accounts for you.

With that, you can easily find helpful articles within this help center for setting up and troubleshooting your roster. Plus, we can more readily implement your feedback about improving the rostering process because we have full control over how the Studies Weekly CSV rostering process is handled, and are not working through a third party rostering system. Automated Rostering through FTP If your district is familiar with using a file transfer protocol (FTP) client and syncing that with the district Student Information System (SIS) data, then the rostering process through Studies Weekly CSV can be automated. This accommodates changes you make in your SIS, automatically generating new files and updating the FTP server that connects with Studies Weekly Online. Because Studies Weekly Online syncs all files on a nightly basis, your roster will be updated daily. Single Sign-On through Google If the teacher and student accounts are rostered using Google-sourced emails for the usernames of the accounts, you can quickly and easily access Studies Weekly Online without the need to memorize a username or password. After verifying their Google Account, students and teachers can use one of the following options to automatically log in each time:1. Go through our [Single Sign-on interface](https://online.studiesweekly.com/online/google) 2. Go to [online.studiesweekly.com](https://online.studiesweekly.com/login) and select the **LOGIN WITH GOOGLE** button.

Studies Weekly typically ships via FedEx, one box per teacher, the full year sent at one time. Each class will receive a blue box with the full year of student publications and teacher materials inside. The box will be labeled with the school name, address, grade level, publication, invoice number, and purchase order number.

#  Clever - Troubleshooting 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
This article covers some of our most common questions we receive from Clever users. Additional questions can be directed to .
**Why can't the student I added to the roster log in through Clever?**
Was the student added to the roster in Clever and shared to Studies Weekly or were they just added to the Student Information System(SIS) roster? Also, we sync your roster data on a nightly basis. Check if the student was added to the roster after last night's sync. From your admin account, can you see if the most recent nightly sync was successful or is it showing up as failed? If your sync is failing, reach out to rostering@studiesweekly.com
**Why can't our teachers invite co-teachers into their classroom?**
Teachers, students, and classrooms created through automated rostering can only be updated through the roster. If a rostered teacher tries to invite a rostered or unrostered teacher to their rostered classroom, they will not be able to join. They will need to be added as a co-teacher of the classroom in Clever.
**Why do my students see classes that aren't associated with Studies Weekly in their account?**
We advise roster administrators with your district to make sure they are only sharing admins, teachers, students, and classes that are utilizing the Studies Weekly publication. If you have students with classes that are not associated with Studies Weekly in their account, please reach out to your district roster administrator and have them filter out the classrooms on the Clever roster that is shared with Studies Weekly.
**Another school in our district purchased Studies Weekly during the school year. Why don't they have access to Clever even though I have added them to the roster we are sharing with you?**
When we approve your district's request to roster with Clever, we set your Clever license count to the amount of schools you originally requested to roster with Studies Weekly Online. If you would like to add a license for another school, please reach out to rostering@studiesweekly.com.
Troubleshooting Help

#  Article Comprehension Questions 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Article comprehension questions are designed to help students learn how to identify evidence from the reading to support a claim. Students receive immediate feedback when completing article comprehension questions and are incentivized to complete each question correctly in as few attempts as possible in order to earn as many coins as possible.
This provides a chance to learn and improve without the pressure of being graded, which can often induce fear of failure. Unlike our Weekly Assessments, the questions on article comprehension are not tied to specific standards and are intentionally not graded.
Article comprehension questions are worth 10, 5, 3, or 1 coin(s) depending on how many tries it takes to get the correct answer.
  * 1st attempt = 10 coins
  * 2nd attempt = 5 coins 
  * 3rd attempt = 3 coins
  * Last attempt = 1 coins


There is no submit button, so students are automatically awarded these coins based on the number of attempts.
Below are additional articles that discuss comprehension questions and awarding coins.

#  OneRoster CSV - Troubleshooting 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
This article covers some of the most common questions we receive from OneRoster CSV users. Additional questions can be directed to .
**My student is rostered, why can't they log in?**
1. Check the CSV files to confirm that the student was on them and was shared to Studies Weekly Online.2. Check when they were added to the roster. Were they added after last night's sync? (Remember, we sync your roster data on a nightly basis).3. Contact your district rostering administrator. They will need to log in through their rostering admin account, to check if the most recent sync was successful. If the sync failed, they can reach out to .
**Why can't our teachers invite co-teachers into their classroom?**
Teachers, students, and classrooms created through automated rostering can only be updated through the OneRoster system. If a rostered teacher tries to invite a teacher to their rostered classroom, the new teacher won’t be able to join. They need to be added as a co-teacher of the classroom through OneRoster.
**Why do my students see classes in their account that aren't associated with Studies Weekly?**
If your students see other classes besides your Studies Weekly classroom, it is because your district rostering admin shared this information in their Student Information System (SIS) rostering data given to Studies Weekly.Depending on the type of roster server the district is using, your district may be unable to filter out data from the SIS when we sync your roster files each night. There are some roster servers and SIS servers that don't provide the ability to filter the data that is being shared to the CSV files that are uploaded to the Studies Weekly FTP server. Because of this, there may be teachers, students, and classrooms that are created in Studies Weekly Online for users that are not using the Studies Weekly publication.If they have the ability to do so, the district roster admin should filter out any teachers, students, and classrooms that aren't utilizing Studies Weekly Online before sharing their OneRoster CSV file.

#  How to Manage Assessments 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Studies Weekly Online offers multiple ways to assess students’ progress.
After each week within a Unit, there is a Weekly Assessment, found in the Table of Contents. To familiarize yourself with the Table of Contents, visit the [How to Navigate the Table of Contents](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/5465616070427-How-to-Navigate-the-Table-of-Contents) article in the [Help Center](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us).
Before students take assessments, they prepare by answering formative comprehension questions at the end of each article. Students earn coins by answering the questions and can use their coins to play the embedded online games called [Study Buddies](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/9339007403931-How-to-Play-Study-Buddies) and [Explorers](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/5481133657115-How-to-Play-Explorers).
Once students have completed all the Weekly Assessments, they will be ready to take the summative Unit Assessment. Not every publication will have a Unit Assessment. 
**Preview and Edit the Assessment**
Teachers can preview assessments from the Table of Contents of the publication.
In the Table of Contents, navigate to the desired week and click the **Assessment**. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37638223474587)
This will open the **Student View** of the assessment. Here, teachers can preview the questions and take the assessment as a student. If you would like to make changes, click the **Teacher Actions** dropdown, then select the **+Customized Content** button. This will create a copy of the assessment so it can be edited.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31052748030363)
Questions can be removed, reorganized, and additional questions can be added. For detailed instructions on creating customized content visit the [How to Create Customized Content](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/4861136293787-How-to-Create-Customized-Content) article.
**Assign the Assessment**
By default the assessment is **enabled** and visible to the students in the selected classroom. To disable or make it hidden, click the blue toggle. It will turn gray and be hidden from students. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/37638228334747)
**Grade the Assessment**
Assessments are automatically graded, but teachers may need to grade an open response question. To grade open response questions, navigate to Grade and follow the steps in the article [How to Navigate the Grade Section](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13879825760155-How-to-Navigate-the-Grade-Section).

#  How Students View Their Scores 
FollowNot yet followed by anyone
Students can see some of their scores immediately after submitting activities and assessments. If the submission has questions that require teacher grading (e.g., open response), then students will see the message “Some questions still need to be graded.” Once the teacher grades it, students can view their score online.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/38793074740507)
#### To see their overall scores for each week, students can:
  1. Click on a publication in a Class Card or click the **View All Publications** button.
  2. Once a publication has been selected, the **Table of Contents** will open and students will see which assessments they have taken and their percentage score. ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/38793067012379)


#### To see their scores for each teacher created task, students can:
  1. Go to the **To Do** tab.
  2. Click the **Graded** tab.
  3. Click the **Review** button on the task they want to see.![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/31266449074459)


#### When reviewing their submissions, students will see the number of attempts, date and score. For each submission they will be able to:
  * See questions they answered correctly in green.
  * See questions they answered incorrectly in red and the correct answer.
  * See any open response questions their teacher needs to grade.
  * Comment on their response or score by typing in the text box and clicking the send button.![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/26945887221915)

  4. Choose whether to allow teachers to: 
     *        * Edit the District Customized Content (title and instructions only).

**Utilizing Folders**
District admins are encouraged to create Folders to house the Customized Content items they create. Folders can be created before, during, or after creating Customized Content. Creators can also have a Folder within a Folder. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/36459178032027)
Studies Weekly recommends titling your Folder(s) for specific content areas, schools, or for the author of the content. After naming your Folder(s) and assigning a color, click **Create**.

Folders can be edited or removed later by using the **3 dots menu** next to the name of the Folder. Only empty Folders can be **Removed**. 
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/36459178033307)
Customized Content items not assigned to a Folder will be shown under the Customized Content list.
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/36459178034971)
As the school year goes on district admins may need to use the search bar or filter options to locate specific items. ![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/36459222730139)
![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/36459178036763)
District Customized Content can be shared individually with teachers or with all teachers assigned to selected schools containing a specific activated publication.
Note
Teachers will receive an email and a notification (in their Studies Weekly Online Account Dashboard) that a district admin has shared District Customized Content with them. The content will then need to be assigned to their classes. Visit the [How Teachers Assign District Customized Content](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/en-us/articles/19015898021403-How-Teachers-Assign-District-Customized-Content) article to learn more.

![](https://support.studiesweekly.com/hc/article_attachments/26950018723611)

  2. Choose a publication to filter out extra schools or classes. Publications can be filtered by grade level to narrow down the list. 
  3. Select which schools will receive the content. When schools are selected, teachers in those schools are automatically selected in the next step and then can be filtered.
